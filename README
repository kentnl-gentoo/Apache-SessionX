OVERVIEW
========

Apache::SessionX extents Apache::Session. It was initialy written to
use Apache::Session from inside of HTML::Embperl, but is seems to be
usefull outside of Embperl as well, so here is it as standalone module.

Apache::Session is a persistence framework which is particularly useful
for tracking session data between httpd requests.  Apache::Session is
designed to work with Apache and mod_perl, but it should work under
CGI and other web servers, and it also works outside of a web server
altogether.

Addtionaly to Apache::Session, Apache::SessionX provides the following
possibilites:

- Configuration: Makefile.PL checks which componemnts are installed
  on the system and interactivly builds a set of configuration, 
  including a default one. This configurations are saved and can
  be used by name later on. The default configuration is used, if
  no parameters are given to Apache::SessionX. This simplifies
  the configuration and usage.

- Lazy operation: Apache::SessionX supports lazy operation, that means
  that the actual data access only takes place if the session data is
  needed, so you are able to setup the session object, without worrying
  about performance in case you don't access the session data.

- Specifing the ID: Apache::SessionX can use a given ID instead of
  creating it's own one. You can also give an string which is used to
  generate the ID

- Genrate unique ID: Apache::SessionX is able to save the session with
  an new ID every time data is modified. This make it possible to keep
  an history.

- Addtionaly methods are provided to get the ID, the inital ID, the
  modified status and to close a session, without destroying the
  session object itself.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

After Installation the documentaion could be viewed via

    perldoc Apache::SessionX

You should addtionaly read the 

    perldoc Apache::SessionX
    perldoc Apache::SessionX::Generate::MD5
    perldoc Apache::Session::Store::*
    perldoc Apache::Session::Lock::*
    perldoc Apache::Session::Serialize::*


INSTALLATION
============

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Makefile.PL will ask you what configuration you want to use and saves 
them for later use with the config parameter. This configuration are
tested when you run make test, so it's really a good idea to run 
make test, to make sure everything works as expected. Even better is
to run make test as the user, that your webserver is running as, so
you are able to detected permission problems early.


SUPPORT
=======

You can get support for this module via the mod_perl or Embperl 
mailing list. Please use the lists for any questions and don't
contact me directly. Details about the list can be found at
